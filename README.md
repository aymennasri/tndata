The tndata package simplifies access to Tunisian government open data
with R. It queries datasets by theme, author, or keywords, retrieves
metadata, and gets structured results ready for analysis; all through
the official [data.gov.tn](data.gov.tn) CKAN API.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tndata from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("aymennasri/tndata")
```
